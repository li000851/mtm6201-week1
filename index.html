				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Siwei Li(41061573) and I am currently a student of Iteractive Media Design at Algonquin College.</p>
				<p>For over two years, I was employed as a designer at a video game company, a role that allowed me to merge my creativity with my passion for gaming. However, I have recently transitioned into a freelance designer role, which gives me the flexibility to work on various projects while also enjoying my personal time. </p>
				<p>When I'm not working, I love spending time at home with my dog, a loyal companion with whom I enjoy watching TV and playing video games. Our shared relaxation time is a cherished part of my daily routine. </p>
				<p>In addition to this, I have a keen interest in outdoor activities. I find hiking and traveling particularly rewarding as they provide an opportunity to disconnect from the digital world, rejuvenate, and gain fresh perspectives.</p>
